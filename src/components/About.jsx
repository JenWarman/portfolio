            Hi, Iâ€™m Jen, a UI/UX designer currently based in Nottingham, UK and
            have been designing for over 13 years.<br></br>
            <br></br>With a background in surface pattern design I more recently
            embarked on a career in UI/UX design and Software Development. While
            living in Berlin, Germany I volunteered as a web administrator for
            the Berlin Kreativ Kollektiv, and since returning to the UK I began
            volunteering as website manager for Borderline Arts. I wanted to
            deepen my understanding of web applications, which led me to
            completing a 13 week Software Development bootcamp at Northcoders.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>Now I continue to expand my design knowledge and utilise my
            improved technical and interpersonal skills to create engaging
            digital design solutions.
